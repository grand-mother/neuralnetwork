# Triggering with Neural Networks
This is a project performed by Florian FÃ¼hrer, Tom Charnock and Anne Zilles.

Based on ZHAireS simulations for Cosmic Rays and neutrino events for a GRAND-like toymodel array, we studied the efficiency of using Deep Neural Networks to identify signals in a background dominated environment. Those detected signals should then feed neural networks which are able to do a fast online-reconstruction of the shower parameters based on the time traces collected from the array.

Temporary results can be found in the ARENA 2018 proceedings: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01934.pdf
