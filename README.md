# Triggering with Neural Networks
This is a project performed by Florian Führer, Tom Charnock and Anne Zilles.

Based on ZHAireS simulations for Cosmic Rays and neutrino events for a GRAND-like toymodel array, we studied the efficiency to use Deep Neural Networks to identify signals in a background dominated environment.
